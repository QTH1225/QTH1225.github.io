# About Me

<img src="https://qth1225.github.io/qintianhao.jpg" class="floatpic">

Here is **Tianhao Qin (秦天浩)**.<br>

I am an undergraduate student in the School of Mechanics &Civil Engineering at the China University of Mining and Technology, advised by [Prof Shiping Yin ](https://cace.cumt.edu.cn/info/1201/15167.htm), within [Green Materials and Building Industrialization Theory and Research Team](https://cace.cumt.edu.cn/info/1479/31679.htm). Before joining this team, I have conducted research on China's carbon peak and carbon neutrality goals, as well as machine learning, with [AP Yaning Qiao]([‪Yaning Qiao‬ - ‪Google Scholar‬](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gxVZszAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)).<br>

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at - 02210632@cumt.edu.cn

## Research Interests

**I am actively seeking a PhD position for 2028 Fall admission. If you have any information, please contact me!**

- [Green Materials and Building Industrialization Theory and Research Team](https://cace.cumt.edu.cn/info/1479/31679.htm)
- Concrete Structure Reinforcement and Repair
- New concrete materials (FRP, TRC, UHPC, etc.)
- Applied Machine Learning

My current research focuses on durability of reinforced concrete in coastal area and reinforcement measures. I am interested in the application of  new materials
# (such as FRP, UHPC) and new methods (such as machine learning, neural networks) in concrete structures. In short, the new green building materials have a positive impact on everyone's life. I wish to devote my talent to this meaningful cause and bring well-being to society.
